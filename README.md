# Protein Phosphorylation Site Prediction and Location Based Deep Learning
Phosphorylation is the most extensively studied post-translational modification, playing a crucial role in various biological processes. This paper proposes a deep learning-based protein phosphorylation site prediction model and a method for protein phosphorylation site localization combined with PTMiner, a localization software based on the mass spectra. The model integrates ESM-2 and FCNN, enabling automatic feature extraction from protein sequence, thereby achieving precise prediction of phosphorylation sites. To address data imbalance and mitigate the randomness of sampling, we employ multi-round downsampling experiments to ensure the stability of our results. Additionally, we experimentally determine the optimal window length and ESM-2 parameter scale to optimize model performance. Through ablation studies and model comparisons, we validate the effectiveness of each model component. The results demonstrate that the model we constructed outperforms other methods across various evaluation metrics. In mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, some spectra lack site-determining ions, making it impossible to accurately locate phosphorylation modifications. This paper showcases the utility of our model in assisting the modification localization software PTMiner to accomplish protein phosphorylation site localization, and experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of this approach.
